# Astro conventions

## Astro-first

- Prefer `.astro` components for pages and presentational UI.
- Use React only for interactive islands; keep islands small and isolated.

## Accessibility + UX

- Use semantic HTML (headings in order, buttons for actions, links for navigation).
- Ensure keyboard navigation and visible focus states.
- Avoid CLS: always size images and reserve space for dynamic content.

## Data boundaries

- Fetch Sanity content at build time for static pages when possible.
- Keep data-shaping logic in TS helpers so it can be unit tested.
