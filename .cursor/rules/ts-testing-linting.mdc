# TS/JS rules (oxlint + vitest)

## Linting

- Use **oxlint** as the primary linter for TS/JS.
- Keep imports tidy; no unused vars/exports; prefer explicit types where it clarifies intent.

## Unit tests (Vitest)

- Test pure functions and data transforms (Sanity query helpers, mapping, sorting/filtering, formatting).
- Keep tests deterministic: avoid real network; mock time/IDs when needed.
- Prefer clear test names: `it('returnsFeaturedProjectsSortedByOrder', ...)`.

## React (only when needed)

- If interactive UI is required, use React islands; keep logic testable and covered with Vitest with react testing library.
