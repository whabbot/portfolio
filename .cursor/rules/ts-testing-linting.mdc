# TS/JS rules (oxlint + vitest)

## Linting

- Use **oxlint** as the primary linter for TS/JS.
- Keep imports tidy; no unused vars/exports; prefer explicit types where it clarifies intent.

## Unit tests (Vitest)

- Test pure functions and data transforms (Sanity query helpers, mapping, sorting/filtering, formatting).
- Keep tests deterministic: avoid real network; mock time/IDs when needed.
- Prefer clear test names: `it('returnsFeaturedProjectsSortedByOrder', ...)`.

## React (build-time only)

- React is a build-time dependency for shadcn/ui — do not ship React to the client.
- For interactive UI, prefer Astro components with inline scripts; test via plain DOM APIs in jsdom.
- If a future feature genuinely requires React on the client, test it with `@testing-library/react` (re-add as needed).
