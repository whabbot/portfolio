# Docs conventions (context-optimized)

## `prd.md`

- Goals / non-goals
- Pages + core user stories
- Content model fields (Projects, Experience)
- Acceptance criteria (short bullets)

## `design.md`

- IA + navigation
- Component inventory
- Visual rules (Tailwind tokens, typography/spacing)
- Responsive + accessibility notes

## General

- Keep docs short; prefer bullet points.
- Record decisions when they affect implementation direction.
